    Hello 👋 I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/scotups">Scott Moss</a> and welcome to my Intro to Node.js course!
    I'm a Sr. Software Engineer at Netflix where I work on the TV app. I've been
    teaching courses and giving talks on JS since 2013. It's my secret to learning
    faster.

## Course
There's so much to learn when it comes to Node.js. So the approach we're going to take in this
course is to build an example or two of some of the best use cases of Node.js.
Think of it as building mini apps for each topic.
