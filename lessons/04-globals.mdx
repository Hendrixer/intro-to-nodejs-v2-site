title: Globals
---

Like the Browser, Node.js comes with some practical globals for us to use
in our applications.

## Common

* `global`
Think of this as like `window` but for Node.js. **DON'T ABUSE IT**!

* `__dirname`
This global is a `String` value that points to the directory name of the
file it's used in.

* `__filename`
Like `__dirname`, it too is relative to the file it's written in. A `String` value
that points to the file name.

* `process`
A swiss army knife global. An `Object` that contains all the context you need
about the current program being executed. Things from env vars, to what machine you're
on. 

* `exports` `module` `require`
These globals are used for creating and exposing modules throughout your app. We'll
get to modules in a second ðŸŒˆ

## The rest
Depending on what version of Node.js you're running, there are so many more globals.
Not as many as the Browser, but enough that you'll probably never use many of them.
