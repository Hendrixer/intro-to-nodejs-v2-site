title: Deployment
---
Now that you can develop with Node.js, you need to learn how to get
your apps off your local machine and into the world. Depending on what 
your app does will determine how you deploy it.

## Packages
For CLI's, Libraries, Plugins, etc, you would publish these to NPM so
other devs can install it. The NPM CLI makes this easy. Let's take our
CLI that we created and publish it.

First thing is to make sure you have a unique package name in the name field of
`package.json`. NPM will let you know when you try to publish. Next, create a
NPM account. Once you've done that, you need to log in to NPM from your terminal with

`npm login`

We're now ready to publish. Just run:

`npm publish` 

And that's it. Your CLI can now be installed with `npm install [name]`.

## Servers
For API's and background tasks that run operations on API's or databases, you'd
deploy these to a hosting provider like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud, etc.
Let's deploy our Server! We'll be using Heroku for this as it's really easy
to deploy an app.

First create a heroku account and then install the [cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
Next, we have to tell heroku how to start our app. We can add a `start` script
in our package.json. We also have to tell heroku what version of Node.js we want to use.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./path/to/server.mjs"
},

"engines": {
  "node": "14.x"
}
```

We have to change a few things to ensure our Server won't crash when deployed. Right now
we have a hard coded port, we need to change that to an environment variable that Heroku
will inject at runtime. We can use `process.env.PORT`. Lastly, make sure
we're not checking in the `node_modules` folder into git by adding it to the
`.gitignore` file. If you don't have one, then create one and add this

```
/node_modules
npm-debug.log
.DS_Store
/*.env
```

These are just some common files and folders that we don't want tracked in git.
We'll be deploying to heroku with git, so we don't want these files in heroku either.
Commit your changes to git, and then login to the heroku CLI

`heroku login`

Next, create a new heroku app:

`heroku create`

Finally, push our server to heroku via git

`git push heroku main`

You'll see the build output of heroku deploying your app. Once it's done, we can
try the live URL.

...And that's it!
