title: Installing Node.js
---

## For Windows
If you're running Windows and are not using WSL, I recommend you use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) from the
Node.js site. Choose the latest LTS version.

## For everyone else
If you're not on Windows or you are using WSL, I recommend installing Node.js with [`nvm` (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
NVM allows you to install many versions of Node.js at once and switch when you need. Also, NVM installs Node.js in a folder that will not have permission
errors that you would otherwise run into with the official installer.

Once you have nvm installed, you need to install a Node version. You can download the latest LTS version with this command.


`nvm install --lts`
