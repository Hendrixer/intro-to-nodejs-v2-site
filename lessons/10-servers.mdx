title: Servers
---

Node.js has access to OS level functionality, like networking tools. This
allows us to build very capable servers. Mixed with the fact that Node.js
is single threaded and runs an even loop for async tasks, Node.js is widely
used for API's that need to respond fast and don't require heavy CPU intensive
work.

## The hard way

Node.js ships with the `http` module. This module is an abstraction
around OS level networking tools. For Node.js, the `http` module would
be considered "low level". Let's create a simple server.

```js
import http from 'http'

const host = 'localhost'
const port = 8000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    let body = ''

    req.on('data', (chunk) => {
      body += chunk.toString()
    })

    req.on('end', () => {
      if (req.headers['content-type'] === 'application/json') {
        body = JSON.parse(body)
      }

      console.log(body)
      res.writeHead(201)
      res.end('ok')
    })
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200)
    res.end('hello from my server')
  }
})

server.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://${host}:${port}`)
})
```

Using the `createServer` method on the http module, we create a server.
Before we start the server, we need to make sure it can handle
incoming requests. That's the callback inside of `createServer`.
Next is starting the server. To do that, we need a port and a host.
Sites default to port `8080` or `8000` so it's not uncommon to use
that when developing locally. The host is going to be your machine,
which is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

Using the `http` module is fine for this small example,
but for bulding real world APIs we should utilize the community
and install some packages to help up with this task.

## Express

There is an awesome packaged, `express`, that makes creating servers
in Node.js a breeze. We're going to use it now.

`npm install express body-parser morgan`

- `express` - a framework for building servers
- `body-parser` - a middleware that parses incoming requests
- `morgan` = a middleware for logging incoming requests

With everything installed, we'll create a simple API for a todo app using
express.

```js
import express from 'express'
import morgan from 'morgan'
import bp from 'body-parser'

const { urlencoded, json } = bp

const db = {
  todos: [],
}

const app = express()

app.use(urlencoded({ extended: true }))
app.use(json())
app.use(morgan('dev'))

app.get('/todo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: db.todos })
})

app.post('/todo', (req, res) => {
  const newTodo = { complete: false, id: Date.now(), text: req.body.text }
  db.todos.push(newTodo)

  res.json({ data: newTodo })
})

app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('Server on http://localhost:8000')
})
```

Compared to the native `http` module, express feels
like cheating.

Our todo API has two routes:

- `GET /todo` - get all todos
- `POST /todo` - create a new todo

Express has a healthy community with tons of plugins
and middleware to help you build out API's. I have a [course
or two](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/api-design-nodejs-v3/) showing you how!
