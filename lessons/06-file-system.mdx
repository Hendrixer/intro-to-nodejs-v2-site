title: File System
---

Until Node.js, there wasn't a great way to access the file system on a machine with
JavaScript, this is due to security restrictions in most browsers. With Node.js,
one can create, edit, remove, read, stream, & more with files. If you've ever used
a build tool like webpack or a parser like babel, then you realize just how powerful
Node.js can be when manipulating the file system.

## Reading a file
Node.js ships with a powerful module, `fs` short for file system. There are many
methods on the [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).
To read a file, we'll use the `readFile` method.

Create a simple html file `template.html`.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
  <p>{body}</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This `html` file will be used as a template and has placeholders
that we will interpolate later when writing a file.

To read the file:
```js
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'

let template = await readFile(new URL('./template.html', import.meta.url), 'utf-8')
```

The `fs` module has support for promise based methods. We'll
opt to use those as they have a cleaner API and using
async + non-blocking methods are preferred. More on that later.
Because we're using `.mjs` files, we don't have access to
`__dirname` or `__filename` which is what is normally
used in combination with the `path` module to form an
appropriate file path for fs. So we have to use the `URL`
global that takes a relative path and a base path and will
create a URL object that is accepted by `readFile`. If you were to
log `template`, you'd see that it's just a string.


## Write a file
Writing a file is similar to reading a file, except you need
some content to place in the file. Let's interpolate the variables
inside our template string and write the final html string back
to disk.

```js
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises'

let template = await readFile(new URL('./test.html', import.meta.url), 'utf-8')

const data = {
  title: 'My new file',
  body: 'I wrote this file to disk using node'
}

for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(data)) {
  template = template.replace(`{${key}}`, val)
}

await writeFile(new URL('./index.html', import.meta.url), template)
```

You should now have a `index.html` file that is the
same as the `template.html` file but with the h1 and body
text substituted with the data object properties. This is some
powerful stuff ðŸ”¥! Open it in a browser and see it work. At their core,
static analysis tools like TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, and Rollup
do just this. Also, please don't use my hacky templating "engine" 
in a real app! ðŸ¤£
