title: Executing Node
---

## Node REPL
Before we get into creating programs and apps with Node.js, let's get our feet wet with the Node.js REPL.
Just type `node` in your terminal. This will create a Node.js environment where we can write and execute
JavaScript. You'll see that all that JS knowledge you have learned carries over to Node.js! ðŸ’¯. Although, some things,
specifically browser based API's probably won't work. Go ahead, try an `alert('hello world')` and see what happens.
You'll get an error. Although the Node.js runtime uses JS as its language, none of the browser based
globals that you are familiar with actually exist in Node.js or they are polyfilled to prevent
runtime errors.

## File Execution
The Node REPL is nice, but you can't build an application with that. We need to be able to
write our code to a file and tell Node.js to execute that.

>Create a file called:`index.js`



In that file, write some JS. Try out `console.log('hello there')`. To execute this .js file
in the Node.js runtime, we can use the `node` command with the file name as an argument.

```
> node index.js
```
